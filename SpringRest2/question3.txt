What exactly happens when context.getBean() is invoked?
When you call:


Country country = context.getBean("country", Country.class);
This process occurs:

Lookup: Spring looks for a bean definition with the ID "country" in its configuration.

Bean Instantiation:

If the bean is not already created (for singleton scope), Spring creates an instance using the class specified in the bean definition.

If prototype scope, it creates a new instance every time.

Dependency Injection:
Spring injects dependencies and sets property values via setter methods or constructor arguments as configured.

Bean Initialization:
Spring completes lifecycle methods such as @PostConstruct or custom init methods if defined.

Return Bean:
The fully initialized bean instance is returned, ready for use.

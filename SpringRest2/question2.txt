ApplicationContext and ClassPathXmlApplicationContext
ApplicationContext:


It is the central interface to access Springâ€™s IoC (Inversion of Control) container. It is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and assembling the beans defined in the Spring configuration.

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext:
A concrete implementation of ApplicationContext that loads the Spring XML configuration file from the classpath (usually src/main/resources). It reads the XML, creates the beans, wires dependencies, and manages the lifecycle.

Usage Example:

ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("country.xml");


This loads the country.xml from the classpath and initializes the beans defined inside.

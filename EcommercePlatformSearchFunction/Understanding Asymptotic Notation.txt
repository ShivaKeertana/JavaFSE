BIG O NOTATION - 
Big O notation describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows relative to the input.
It describes the worst case or the lower bound for an algorithm.

BEST CASE SCENARIO -
There are 2 main search algorithms. 
Linear search is used for unordered data. In this search, the best case occurs when the element we are searching for is at the first index.
O(1).
The second search technique is Binary Search. In binary search the best case scenario is when the element we are searching for is at the mid position.
O(1).

WORST CASE SCENARIO -
Linear search: When the element is at the last position. 
O(n) where n is the size of the array.
Binary Search : when the element is in corner of every combination of left and right arrays. 
O(log n)

AVERAGE CASE SCENARIO -
Linear Search : when the element is in the middle
O(n/2) = O(n)
Binary Search : O(log n)

OBJECTIVES - 

1. Define SPA (Single Page Application) and Its Benefits
A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the appâ€”without reloading the entire page.
Benefits of SPAs :
Fast navigation
improved user experience
reduced server load
Easier to develop APIs


2. Define React and Identify Its Working
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It is maintained by Meta (Facebook).
Workings of React :
It uses components to build UI elements
It implements virtual DOM to efficiently update the real DOM
Uses state and props to manage dynamic data
It re-renders only parts of the page that change, improving performance.


3. Differences between SPA and MPA
	1. SPA Loads once, then updates dynamically	
	   MPA Each interaction loads a new HTML page
	2. SPA are Faster (after initial load)	
	   MPA Slower (due to full-page reloads)
	3. SPA Seamless, fluid	
	   MPA Less fluid, more like traditional sites
	4. SPA Harder to implement SEO	
 	   MPA Easier for SEO
	5. SPA More complex front-end logic	
           MPA Easier with server-side rendering


4. Explain Pros & Cons of Single-Page Application
PROS :
1. Faster user experience after initial load
2. Efficient network usage (only fetches data)
3. Reusable UI components
4. Easier to turn into mobile apps with frameworks like React Native

Cons:
1. SEO can be challenging
2. First load time can be longer
3. Requires JavaScript to be enabled
4. May be less secure if not handled properly




5. Explain About React
React is a declarative, component-based library used for building dynamic and interactive UIs.

Key Concepts:
1. JSX: HTML + JS syntax to write components
Components: Small, reusable code blocks (either functional or class-based)
2. State & Props: Used to manage and pass data
3. Hooks: Functions like useState, useEffect to add features to functional components



6. Define Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight copy of the real DOM maintained by React.

How It Works:
1. When state changes, React updates the VDOM.
2. It compares the new VDOM with the old one (diffing).
3. Only the differences are updated in the real DOM (reconciliation).
4. This makes updates faster and more efficient than direct DOM manipulation.


7. Features of React
Component-Based Architecture: Reusable UI pieces.
Virtual DOM: Boosts rendering performance.
JSX Syntax: Clean and readable way to write components.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Predictable and controlled state updates.
React Hooks: Manage state and side-effects in functional components.
React Native: Build mobile apps with the same principles.
Rich Ecosystem: Supported by tools like Redux, React Router, etc.
